# Backgammon
A simple variation on backgammon. Rules are slightly different than the official rules.

Currently all checkers start on the first tile/point. You have to throw the dices and then you can select two checkers to move the amount of a dice. A checker can move to an empty point or to a point whitch already contrains a checker of yours. Furthermore it can also move to a point that contains only one checker of the opponent. In this case the opponents checker will get captured and has to start at the edge of the board. If a checker reaches the end than it will be removed from the board. It is allowed to overshoot at the end, thus if you are at the last point and throw a 4, your checker can still be removed.
The goal is to be the first where all the checkers has reached the end.
